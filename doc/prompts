Master Prompts for MindfulThai App on Lovable.dev
Below are the consolidated master prompts in English for designing and developing the "MindfulThai" mental health mobile app on Lovable.dev, targeting young adults (18-40) in Thailand. The prompts cover all steps for creating a calming, intuitive, and privacy-focused app with Thai/English support.
Step 1: Project Setup and App Overview
Create a new mobile app project in Lovable.dev named "MindfulThai" for young adults (18-40) in Thailand, focused on mental health with AI-powered features. Support Thai and English languages with seamless switching. Use a calming color palette: soft blue (#E6F0FA), mint green (#D4F4E2), white, and dark green (#2E7D32) for CTAs. Apply Sarabun font for Thai text and Poppins for English text, ensuring readability on iOS and Android. Enable responsive design with subtle micro-animations for button clicks and screen transitions. Prioritize privacy with PDPA (Thailand) and GDPR compliance.

Step 2: Navigation Structure
Design a bottom navigation bar for MindfulThai with five sections: Home, AI Chat, Content, Therapist, and Profile. Use SVG icons and bilingual labels (Thai/English, Sarabun/Poppins fonts). Ensure intuitive navigation with hover states (soft blue #E6F0FA) and click animations (scale 1.1x). Set Home as the default screen. Save the navigation structure for reuse across all screens.

Step 3: Home Screen Design
Design the Home screen for MindfulThai with a minimalistic layout, including:
- A daily mood summary card (AI-generated, placeholder text) with a soft blue (#E6F0FA) background.
- A prominent dark green (#2E7D32) CTA button labeled "Start Meditation" (Thai/English toggle).
- A scrollable list of mental health tips in cards (mint green #D4F4E2 background, Sarabun/Poppins text).
- A non-intrusive "Upgrade to Premium" button linking to a subscription page.
Add micro-animations for button clicks (fade effect) and card scrolling (slide-in). Ensure responsiveness for iOS and Android.

Step 4: AI Chat Feature
Create an AI Chat screen for MindfulThai with a conversational UI, including:
- A chat bubble interface with text/voice input (Thai/English) at the bottom.
- Empathetic AI responses (e.g., "You seem stressed, want to try a 5-minute breathing exercise?") in Sarabun/Poppins.
- A suggestion chip (e.g., "Try a breathing exercise") in mint green (#D4F4E2).
- A "Save Mood" button (dark green #2E7D32) for secure data storage.
Integrate an AI model to analyze mood from text/voice input, ensuring PDPA/GDPR-compliant storage. Add micro-animations for message sending (slide-up) and suggestion chip hover (scale 1.1x). Save the chat UI as a reusable component.

Step 5: Content Section (Meditation and Articles)
Design the Content screen for MindfulThai with a grid layout, including:
- Guided meditations (5/10/15-minute options, themes like sleep/stress relief) with nature-themed thumbnails (e.g., forest, beach).
- Breathing exercises with simple animations (e.g., expanding circle).
- Mental health articles with preview cards.
Each item includes a title (Thai/English, Sarabun/Poppins) and play/read button (dark green #2E7D32). Support Thai/English audio for meditations. Add a free vs premium toggle, with premium items marked. Include micro-animations for grid selection (fade-in) and audio playback start (pulse effect). Ensure responsive design.

Step 6: Therapist Booking Feature
Design the Therapist screen for MindfulThai with a filterable therapist list (by price, expertise). Each therapist card includes a photo, name, bio, and "Book Now" button (dark green #2E7D32). Create a scheduling modal with a calendar (Thai/English date formats) and a payment confirmation screen (showing price, date, therapist name). Highlight premium-only booking options with an "Upgrade to Premium" CTA. Add micro-animations for filter application (slide-down) and booking confirmation (checkmark fade-in). Ensure PDPA-compliant data handling.

Step 7: Profile and Gamification
Design the Profile screen for MindfulThai, including:
- A progress bar for meditation streaks (mint green #D4F4E2 fill).
- A badge gallery for gamification rewards (e.g., "3-Day Streak").
- Settings for language (Thai/English toggle) and notifications.
- An "Upgrade to Premium" button (dark green #2E7D32).
Show encouraging messages (e.g., "3 days of meditation! Unlock premium content with 10 points!") in a popup. Add micro-animations for badge unlocks (sparkle effect) and progress bar updates (fill animation). Store user data securely with PDPA/GDPR compliance.

Step 8: Feedback Form and Dashboard
Create a Feedback Form screen for MindfulThai with a minimal UI, including:
- A text input for comments (Thai/English, Sarabun/Poppins).
- A 5-star rating system.
- A submit button (dark green #2E7D32, scale 1.1x animation).
Design a Feedback Dashboard screen with:
- A bar chart for satisfaction scores (1-5 stars, soft blue #E6F0FA bars).
- A pie chart for common issues (e.g., UI issues, mint green #D4F4E2 segments).
Store feedback data securely (PDPA/GDPR-compliant). Add micro-animations for chart loading (fade-in) and form submission (toast: "Feedback submitted!").

Step 9: Privacy Consent Screen
Design a Privacy Consent screen for MindfulThai, shown on first launch, including:
- Clear text (Thai/English, Sarabun/Poppins) explaining data usage (AI mood analysis, therapist bookings).
- A PDPA/GDPR consent checkbox.
- An "Agree" button (dark green #2E7D32, fade animation).
Ensure the screen is non-intrusive and skippable after consent. Store consent data securely.

Step 10: Usability Testing and A/B Testing
Configure A/B testing in Lovable.dev for MindfulThai with two scenarios:
1. Test Home screen CTA button text: "Start Now" vs "Try Meditation". Measure click-through rate.
2. Test Home screen background colors: soft blue (#E6F0FA) vs mint green (#D4F4E2). Measure engagement (time spent, session length).
Create a testing plan for 50 young adults (18-40) in Thailand via remote prototype links. Collect feedback via the in-app Feedback Form. Display results in the Feedback Dashboard with visualizations (bar chart for click-through rates, line chart for engagement metrics).

Step 11: Prototyping and Final Integration
Generate interactive iOS and Android prototypes for MindfulThai in Lovable.dev, including all screens (Home, AI Chat, Content, Therapist, Profile, Feedback Form, Feedback Dashboard, Privacy Consent). Link navigation, interactions, and micro-animations. Ensure Thai/English text (Sarabun/Poppins) displays correctly. Export prototypes as Figma-compatible files and generate a production-ready app bundle for iOS and Android, optimized for responsive design and PDPA/GDPR compliance.

Integration with Folder Structure
Export Lovable.dev outputs to the following folder structure:

/Wireframes: Store wireframes (e.g., Home_Screen_Wireframe_v1.sketch).
/Mockups: Store high-fidelity mockups (e.g., AI_Chat_Mockup_v1.png).
/UI_Kit: Store UI components (buttons, icons, animations).
/Prototypes: Store iOS/Android prototypes (e.g., iOS_Prototype_v1.fig).
/Feedback: Store feedback data (CSV) and dashboard (Figma).

Additional Notes

Cultural Relevance: Include Buddhist mindfulness themes (e.g., Anapanasati breathing) and Thai nature visuals.
Privacy: Ensure PDPA/GDPR compliance in all prompts, especially for AI and booking data.
Lovable.dev Assumptions: Adjust prompts if Lovable.dev lacks features (e.g., voice input, charts).
Memory Context: Prompts reference prior UI/UX requirements. Manage chat history via Data Controls if needed.
